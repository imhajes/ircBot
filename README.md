			<strong>Simple Python IRC Bot</strong></h1>
		<h3>
			Description:</h3>
		<p>
			This is a very simple script that lets you run a bot on your computer, to be controlled through IRC.</p>
		<p>
			It will connect to the chosen server and channel with a random nickname.</p>
		<p>
			You can then run: !com &quot;insert command here&quot; on the IRC channel, to execute the command on all connected bots.</p>
		<p>
			Be aware that this may cause problems if your bots are using different platforms.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			This script is by no means hidden, the terminal will be visible to the user. This can be altered, but be sure to read the disclaimer before doing anything.</p>
		<h3>
			<strong>How to install:</strong></h3>
		<p>
			Download the ircBot.py, change channel and server. Then run it using python version &lt; 2.7.</p>
		<p>
			This is cross platform and is tested on Windows 7, Mac OS, and Linux.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>
			Disclaimer:</h3>
		<p>
			Using the script is your own responsibility. Installing and or running this script on a computer without the owners permission is illegal.</p>
		<p>
			Keep in mind that some IRC servers do not allow these kind of bots. Make sure to consult the IRC servers documentation if you are unsure.</p>
